Description - 
This is an ongoing project at the moment. It is currently deployed with three card games which are war, blackjack, and rummy.
More game will be added in the future. This was created using React, Javascript, CSS, and HTML. It is hosted through vercel
which provides an extremely simplistic way to deploy react applications.

How It Works - 
This website uses React, so it is a single page web application. The initial screen is a "menu", where
the user can select what card game they want to play and then that specific choice is rendered on-screen.

What was learned/What I would do differently next time -
For startes, this was primarily a learning expierence, so it should come with no surprise that this is far from perfect. The
first change I would make is that I would break the react components into smaller pieces as I know this is the best practice
for avoiding large Javascript bundles along with slow render times. Second, there are very few comments which I regretfully
got carried away with not doing them. The third would be to optimize the code better. I was so focused on getting the website
to work that I was not too worried with how the code actually performed.
